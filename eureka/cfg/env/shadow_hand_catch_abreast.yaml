description: This class corresponds to the Catch Abreast task. This environment consists
  of two shadow hands placed  side by side in the same direction and an object that
  needs to be passed. Compared with the previous  environment which is more like passing
  objects between the hands of two people, this environment is  designed to simulate
  the two hands of the same person passing objects, so different catch techniques  are
  also required and require more hand translation and rotation techniques.
