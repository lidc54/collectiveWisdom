description: This class corresponds to the DoorOpenInward task. This environment also
  require a opened door  to be closed and the door can only be pushed inward or initially
  open outward, but because they  can't complete the task by simply pushing, which
  need to catch the handle by hand and then open  or close it, so it is relatively
  difficult.
