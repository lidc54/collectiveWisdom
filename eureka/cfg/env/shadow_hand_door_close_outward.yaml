description: This class corresponds to the DoorCloseOutward task. This environment
  also require a closed door  to be opened and the door can only be pushed inward
  or initially open outward, but because they  can't complete the task by simply pushing,
  which need to catch the handle by hand and then open  or close it, so it is relatively
  difficult.
