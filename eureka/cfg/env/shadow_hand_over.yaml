description: This class corresponds to the HandOver task. This environment consists
  of two shadow hands with palms facing up, opposite each other, and an object that
  needs to be passed. In the beginning,  the object will fall randomly in the area
  of the shadow hand on the right side. Then the hand  holds the object and passes
  the object to the other hand. Note that the base of the hand is  fixed. More importantly,
  the hand which holds the object initially can not directly touch the  target, nor
  can it directly roll the object to the other hand, so the object must be thrown
  up  and stays in the air in the process
