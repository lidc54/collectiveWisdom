description: This class corresponds to the Catch Underarm task. In this task, two
  shadow hands with palms facing upwards are controlled to pass an object from one
  palm to the other. What makes it more difficult  than the Hand over task is that
  the hands' translation and rotation degrees of freedom are no longer  frozen but
  are added into the action space
