description: This class corresponds to the TwoCatchUnderarm task. This environment
  is similar to Catch Underarm,  but with an object in each hand and the corresponding
  goal on the other hand. Therefore, the  environment requires two objects to be thrown
  into the other hand at the same time, which requires  a higher manipulation technique
  than the environment of a single object
